# Brainlock PWA v4.5.1-20250815032356

## Quick deploy (GitHub)
1. Create a repo on GitHub (public works fine).
2. Upload **all files** in this zip to the repo root.
3. Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions** or Branch: **main / root**.
4. Wait for the page to publish, then open it on your phone.
5. Tap the browser menu → **Add to Home Screen** (PWA install).

## Notes
- First launch: open **Settings → Enable Sounds** to allow the loud ding when a session ends.
- To use NL scoring: **Settings → Use NL Scoring**.
- To import your spreadsheet values: convert to JSON shaped like `nl-tables.json` and use **Settings → Import NL Tables**.
- Works fully offline after first load (service worker caches assets).
